FIXME:  figure these out later:
  - to support Sum and Prod types, we need WHList and then we will need predicates
    or we need to recognize Sum as (+) similarly to List and (:)
    but this would be slower
      -- - s :*: Sum(x,y,z) -> Sum(s :*: x, s :*: y, s :*: z)

    CONFLUENCE:  start by normalizing sums and prods
                 - 0 in a sum always disappears, reduces number of ops
                 - 0 in prod always produces zero with fewer ops
                 - 1 in prod always reduces the number of ops
                 - we are looking for minimum number of ops for a normal form
  - if we want to substitute values for variables, we need to add support
  - DVar support will be needed for differentiation
  - RelElem help!
